<p>　　What is so good about the Diamonds Sutra? It is simple and clear, nothing verbose. It tells the truth that “everything with form is unreal”.  
<p>　　You allow your mind to be stirred in every situation, you start thinking and keep thinking. Poor you, torturing yourself! Who gives it to you? You yourself, you ask for it. How to practise Buddhism on seeing things with your eyes? By keeping the mind from being stirred, by not starting to think. You see them clearly and you understand what you see. But you keep your mind in a quiet state without thinking. This is genuine practice. The eyes achieve samadhi on seeing things.  Mahaprajnaparamita Sutra explains the principle to enable you to understand the facts and the truth, and to let go.  Letting go is the realm of the Buddha. Otherwise, you remain trapped in the Six Paths of Rebirth of the sentient beings. 　　</html>
