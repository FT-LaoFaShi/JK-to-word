<p>　　If people praise one another, the communities will thrive. If people mistrust and suspect one another, the communities have no future. However glorious they may shine is only an illusion. To study the sutras is to sing praises. You must study the sutras. Without studying them you are lost. To study the sutras is to connect with the Buddhas, the Bodhisattvas and the saints. Not to study them is to connect with the mortals.  Connecting with mortals brings us problems and a hard life.
<p>　　By connecting with the Buddhas and the Bodhisattvas, you will live happily. From morning to night and from the first day of the year to the last day of the year you will have no worries. This is the way to attain ultimate freedom from our being.
