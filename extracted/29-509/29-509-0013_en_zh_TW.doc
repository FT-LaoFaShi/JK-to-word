<p>　　What causes rise or decline of a community where people practice Buddhism? If people get along with one another, the community will thrive. If people criticise one another, the community will decline. This is true no matter how big the community is. You must observe carefully.　　People must learn to praise instead of making enemy with others. Finally, we select Ten Great Vows of Samantabhadra. Samantabhadra proposes Ten Great Vows in Avataṃsaka Sūtra, from respecting Buddhas, praising Buddhas, to dedicating merits to all sentient beings. Dedicating merits to all sentient beings helps broaden one’s mind. All sentient beings are past parents and future Buddhas, so we need to see them as Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. 　　Everything in this world is false. Nothing is real. We commit guilt when doing false things. We attain rebirth in Pure Land when we do right things. 　　</html>
