<p>　　How to tell whether it is true or false? As quantum theory puts it, everything from a mind stirred is false. With the whole universe in front of me, it is false once my mind is stirred and I start thinking. It is true once I keep my mind in a quiet state and do not think. Trueness and falseness is the same. Trueness is falseness, and falseness is trueness. Why? Because trueness does not entail birth and death, but falseness entails birth and death. That is why there is birth and death once you stir your mind and start thinking, but there is neither birth nor death once you keep your mind in a quiet state and do not think.  This is fascinating. You must be determined not to hurt yourself. Who saves you? You save yourself. Does the Buddha save you? No. The Buddha merely explains the facts and the truth. Once you manage to understand it and you follow the Buddha’s Teachings, then you will have proven yourself and be in the same state as the Buddha’s.　　</html>
