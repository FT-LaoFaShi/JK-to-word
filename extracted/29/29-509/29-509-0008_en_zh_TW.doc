<p>　　In the past three thousand years there used to be more than twenty different cultures. Now, there is only one, the Chinese culture. Chinese culture still exists, but the others no longer exist. Why? Because science caused the foundation of religion to collapse. Scientists told people that religion is an illusion, it is unreal. So, religion collapsed. Although some religions survive, yet they are superstitions, their beliefs are unfounded. There are believers who can recite religion texts led by a clergyman in church, just like the Chinese in Buddhist devotional gathering that is ceremonial and ritualistic in nature. So, this is a crisis. What should be done about religion? We support the view that religion is education, not superstition. That is why we must return religion to the basics. We hope that Religion Instructors can clearly and precisely explain the religion classics. This will show that religion is not superstition. If you can only recite the religion text but you do not understand its meaning, then that is superstition. Unfounded belief must revert to founded belief.　　</html>
